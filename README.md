# Project Overview 
Our project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP)-based classification pipeline to evaluate Google Location reviews by categorising them into multiple classes (GENUINE, PROMOTION, IRRELEVANT, RANT). The project includes:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Extraction (Text-based features + Text Embeddings)
3. MLP classifier model training
4. Evaluation of model using a gold-standard labeled dataset
5. Performance analysis of each violation, including precision, recall, F1-score, and visualisations
