This place is just a few miles outside Valdez which I thought was a bonus It was surrounded by woods and had some trees throughout the park for shade The bathrooms were clean and the showers were nice The dump station was a little underwhelming Overall Im really glad I stayed here and not one of the gravel lots in valdez,0,0.0279503105590062,322,13,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
